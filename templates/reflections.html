  <h1 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">Reflection – Task 2</h1>

  <section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">1. What extra features have you added in Task 1.1, and why?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      In Task 1.1 I converted the original static CSV dump into a fully interactive, user-centric dashboard. Rather than
      presenting a single unfiltered table, users now see two D3.js charts—a sentiment distribution bar chart and a breakdown
      of negative-reason categories—embedded in responsive cards. I added a “Filter by Airline” dropdown that dynamically
      repopulates both charts for the selected carrier, eliminating any need for manual data slicing. Under the hood, I
      refactored all chart code into one <code>visualizations.js</code> module with helper functions:
      <code>filterData()</code> handles exact-match and grouped filters (e.g. grouping JetBlue and Spirit under Delta), while
      shared scale and axis logic lives in common routines so styling and behavior remain consistent.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I also introduced per-bar color scales (using D3’s <code>schemeCategory10</code>), increased axis label fonts to
      improve readability, and added extra bottom margins so rotated labels never clip. To boost accessibility, each
      <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> now has an ARIA role and tooltip support shows exact counts on hover. Error states display
      a “No data available” message when an airline has no tweets. Finally, smooth transitions animate bars between states
      rather than redrawing abruptly. These enhancements transform a one-dimensional table into a modular, maintainable,
      and highly engaging dashboard.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">2. Why did you add these features?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The new features address three core principles of effective data visualization: clarity, efficiency, and engagement.
      First, clarity: raw tabular data forces users to scan dozens of rows to spot trends. A bar chart immediately reveals
      which sentiment category dominates, and the breakdown chart surfaces top complaint reasons at a glance. Second,
      efficiency: decision-makers need answers quickly. The dynamic dropdown filter collapses a multi-step filtering
      process into a single click, instantly updating both visuals. Grouping related carriers under Delta avoids empty charts
      and mirrors real-world operations. Third, engagement: interactive charts invite exploration. Animated transitions and
      tooltips encourage users to hover, compare, and drill into data points rather than passively read numbers.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Structurally, modularizing JavaScript into reusable functions and leveraging your CSS framework for responsive cards
      speeds up development, ensures consistent styling, and paves the way for future extensions—like adding a date range
      slider or exporting visuals as images. By making the dashboard both intuitive and robust, these features empower users
      to derive insights more rapidly and share findings more effectively.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">3. What are the security issues of WebSocket?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      WebSockets introduce several distinct risks beyond standard HTTP. Without strict origin enforcement, a malicious site
      can perform Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH), opening a socket under a user’s credentials to exfiltrate or
      inject data. Unencrypted <code>ws://</code> traffic is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, exposing sensitive
      messages. Because sockets remain open, attackers can flood the connection with large or rapid messages, triggering
      Denial-of-Service. Injection attacks arise when payloads are inserted unsanitized into the DOM or back-end logic,
      allowing XSS or protocol disruption. Replay attacks can reuse stale tokens absent timestamp/nonce checks. Finally,
      wildcard CORS or missing subprotocol negotiation lets any client guess your endpoints, undermining the Same-Origin Policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">4. What can be done to secure WebSocket?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      A layered defense is key:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li><strong>WSS Encryption:</strong> Deploy under HTTPS so connections auto-upgrade to <code>wss://</code>, TLS-encrypting messages.</li>
      <li><strong>Origin Whitelisting:</strong> Configure <code>cors_allowed_origins</code> to exactly your domain(s), rejecting others.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> Require a valid JWT or session cookie in the initial handshake before accepting connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Payload Validation & Sanitization:</strong> On the server, escape HTML/JS in all messages and validate JSON schema, field lengths, and data types.</li>
      <li><strong>Throttling & Size Limits:</strong> Enforce <code>max_http_buffer_size</code> and rate-limit messages to prevent floods.</li>
      <li><strong>Subprotocol Negotiation:</strong> Declare a custom protocol (e.g. “sentiment_v1”) so only conforming clients connect.</li>
      <li><strong>Heartbeat & Timeouts:</strong> Use ping/pong to close stale sockets and free resources automatically.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Together, these measures block CSWSH, eavesdropping, replay, injection, and DoS attacks—ensuring only authorized, encrypted, and well-formed messages traverse your socket.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">5. What were the things you found particularly challenging in completing Task 1?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Task 1 surfaced several technical hurdles. First, resolving conflicting D3.js versions—legacy code used v3 while new charts required v7—led to namespace collisions. I refactored all scripts to D3 v7, rewriting axis and scale utilities to the new API. Second, integrating real-time updates with Flask-SocketIO initially used Python threads that blocked the event loop; I switched to <code>socketio.start_background_task()</code> with cooperative <code>socketio.sleep()</code> calls, reorganizing the publish logic for thread safety. Third, cross-origin errors on Render forced careful CORS tuning and cache purges to match deployed domains. Fourth, orchestrating chart redraws on filter changes and incoming tweets required precise clearing of SVG elements (<code>selectAll("*").remove()</code>) and recalculating scales and axes to avoid artifacts. Fifth, CSS styling for rotated labels and flexible layouts took multiple iterations to balance bottom margins, tick font sizes, and card widths across viewports. Finally, sparse library documentation meant a lot of trial-and-error to nail D3 axis formatting and SocketIO handshake options.

  <section class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">6. How can you improve your approach to these tasks?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      To streamline future work, I’d adopt a module bundler (Webpack/Rollup) immediately, so I can cherry-pick only the D3 modules I need and avoid bundle conflicts. I’d introduce automated tests early—unit tests for <code>filterData()</code>, integration tests for WebSocket handlers (using a headless client), and end-to-end tests in a staging environment mirroring production. I’d leverage a utility CSS framework to standardize spacing, typography, and grids, reducing custom CSS tweaks. I’d decouple real-time background tasks into a separate worker (e.g., Celery) for better scaling and reliability. I’d document all environment differences (domains, ports, tokens) in a clear README and use environment-specific config files. Finally, I’d break features into small user stories, commit after each micro-improvement, and maintain a changelog—so decisions are recorded and regressions are easier to catch.
